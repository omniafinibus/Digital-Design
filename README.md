# Digital-Design
All digital design projects and assignment which I worked on during my bachelors.
This README provides a comprehensive overview of my Bachelor's project work in digital design, showcasing a progression from foundational concepts to complex system integration

## Project Introduction
My Bachelor's projects spanned various stages of digital design, utilizing hardware description languages (HDLs) like VHDL. These projects aimed to explore and implement fundamental digital components and the workflow of developing more complex systems.

### Assignment 0: And Gate
Implemented a basic AND gate, introducing Quartus' workflow. Verified functionality through simulation.

### Assignment 1: To hex converter
Designed a binary-to-hex converter incorporating 7-segment displays for visual feedback. 

### Assignment 2: 1-bit Adder
Explored full-adder implementation.

### Assignment 3: Collection of gates
Allowing a glimpse of how Quartus synthesizes logic.

### Assignment 4: Full adder: the return of the adder
Scaled adder to handle 4 bits, integrated subtraction module.

### Assignment 5: Learning to add and subtract
Expanded on previous adder work, introducing more complex logic structures.

### Assignment 6: Sliced Design calculator
Utilized 1-bit slices for a calculator design.

### Assignment 7: Fellowship of the latch
Created a simple latch.

### Assignment 8: Two Flip flops
Explored data flip-flops.

### Assignment 9: Return of the Register
Created a multi-bit register.

### Assignment 10: Sequence Detector
Described detector functionality for specific sequences, using look-up tables.

### Assignment 11: A simple "CPU"
Integrated components like adders, control unit, and registers.

### Assignment 12: Students first ALU
Explored additional operations beyond basic ALU functions.

### Assignment 13: The current state of things - Mealy and Moore machines
Created a Mealy and Moore machine.

### Assignment 14: Last In First Out
Created a LIFO register.

### Assignment 15: The early bird gets the worm (FIFO)
Created a FIFO register.

### Assignment 16: Crank up the resolution with a Data Interpolator
Designed a data interpolator.

### Assignment 17: RCC aka the Transposinator
Implemented a row column converter.

### Assignment 18: Digital audio system
Developed the frame controller for a digital audio system.
